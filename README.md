# Music Synced LED Strip Made with an Arduino and C#

As the name indicates, it is a music synced LED strip, but instead of doing it through a sound module or voltage measurements, you connect this LED strip just like you would connect any other strip (no need for any other components), and you let the code do the hard work. Simply choose your data pin, adjust your port in the C# code, run the program and voila, you're done!

## I also made a video that explains how I did it and how it works
